# Virtual-Assistant
An AI trained for our AMORDA-AI app. (Repository [here](https://github.com/MatthewM117/AMORDA-AI))

This is the original repository created for this app, but due to complications with Kivy and tensorflow, I have instead turned this AI into an API in order for us to be able to use React Native to build the app instead.

I have left the code for the old python app here for reference while rebuilding it in javascript, but will probably delete it later.
